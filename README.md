# Plantsy ðŸŒ±

Plantsy is a React app for managing a collection of plants. Users can view, add, mark as sold out, and search for plants. Advanced features allow updating plant prices and deleting plants from the list.

## Features

### Core Deliverables

- **View Plants**: When the app starts, it fetches and displays a list of all plants from the backend.
- **Add New Plant**: Users can add a new plant by submitting the form, which sends a POST request to the server.
- **Mark Plant as Sold Out**: Users can toggle the stock status of a plant to mark it as "In Stock" or "Out of Stock".
- **Search by Name**: Users can search for plants by name, filtering the list dynamically.

### Advanced Features

- **Update Plant Price**: Users can update a plant's price, which persists after refreshing the page.
- **Delete Plant**: Users can delete a plant from the list, and it will not reappear upon refreshing.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
